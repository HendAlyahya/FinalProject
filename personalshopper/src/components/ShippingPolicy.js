            <p>As soon as you place your order, you will receive an order confirmation e-mail.  This means that we have received your order in our system and pre-authorized your credit card for the purchase.  As soon as we receive your order, we automatically reach out to our suppliers to confirm that it is in stock and available for immediate shipment.  If your item is on backorder or unavailable, we will void the pre-authorization and reach out to you via e-mail. 
             If your item(s) are available for immediate shipment (within 5 business days), we will process the charges and submit the order for shipment.</p>
             <h2>Order Shipment</h2><hr></hr>
             <p>The delivery time frame is between 10 to 20 business days. However, you may receive your items much earlier depending on your location. We will send you tracking information within 24 hours of your order  the to the e-mail address you provided when checking out.
                 If you do not receive tracking information from us within 7 business days of your order, feel free to follow up with us at services@personalShopper.com.</p>
                 <h2>Cancellations & Refunds</h2><hr></hr>
                 <p>All orders cancelled after 48 hours. You are able to cancel your order with no penalty if you cancel your order before your order has shipped.  
                     If you order has shipped, you (the buyer) will also be responsible for actual return shipping charges. Refunds will only be issued to the original credit card that you use when placing your order.</p>
